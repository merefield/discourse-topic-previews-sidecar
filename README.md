# discourse-topic-previews (sidecar plugin)

This is a sidecar plugin to add features to the otherwise [standalone TC Topic List Previews](https://github.com/paviliondev/discourse-tc-topic-list-previews):

- 'actionsâ€™ (bookmarking and liking from Topic List)
- Thumbnail Picker in the Topic Meta Editor.
- Optionally suppresses links in excerpts to make them look a lot better

This sidecar also includes some experimental features:

- Colourisation of background based on dominant colour of the thumbnail
- Processing of the thumbnails to remove any black borders (critical to determining the best dominant colour).

You must have the Theme Component installed for it to work/be useful
